  <h1>Spaghetti Bolognese</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    One of my favorite dishes that I always ask my mom to make for me is pasta bolognese. 
    What made it unique for me was she always added in crushed red peppers, which you’ll 
    notice on the ingredient list is optional because I know not everyone wants their bolognese 
    sauce spicy but if you like a little heat.. give it a try!
  </p>
  <p>
    I did in fact make this entire recipe dairy-free which I’ve added the appropriate options 
    for how to do that in the recipe below. I recently discovered a new dairy-free parmesan 
    cheese that is surrrrrrprisingly very similar in both the texture and taste of real parmesan.
    The brand is Violife (not an ad, just a friendly informative mention here!) and I found it at Whole Foods.
